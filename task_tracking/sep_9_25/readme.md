## Recursions

### Data Structure used: Stack
### Basic or standard definition: Method
### Three important conditions
1. Base Condition - Break point, avoids stackOverflow exception.
2. Logics/Business Logics
3. Recursion call

### Internal implementation
1. Every Recursion call push the element into stack
   2. Every return statement - pop element from stack

### Patterns or step-by-step approach to learning recursion
1. Recursion of void calls - Simple tree structure
    1. Base case - only return
    2. Logical or business logics
    3. Recursion call - no return statement
2. Recursion with primitive datatype (int)
   1. Base case - return type of int should be there in base condition
   2. Logic or business logics
   3. Recursion call - return statement is mandatory

Note: Fibonacci series example for recursion for multiple auxiliary space complexity.
