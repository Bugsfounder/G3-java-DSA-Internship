## what are two architecture used in development.
1. **Monolithic Architecture:** In a monolithic architecture, all components of an application—like the user interface, business logic, and data access layer—are tightly integrated into a single, unified codebase.
   - Simplicity: It's often simpler to develop and manage for small, early-stage projects.
2. **Microservices Architecture**: This approach structures an application as a suite of loosely coupled, independently deployable services, with each service handling a specific business capability.
   - Modularity and Flexibility

### where microservices are used ?
Microservices are used to build large, complex applications by breaking them into small, independent services, enabling independent deployment, scaling, and the use of different technologies for different parts of the application. 
### where monolithic are used ?
Monolithic software architecture is used for small-to-medium-sized web applications, internal business tools, simple APIs, and offline desktop applications

### what are nodes in networking?
In networking, nodes are any devices or connection points within a network that can send, receive, or transmit data.

### Is end-to-end wireless possible ?
Yes, end-to-end wireless communication is possible and actively being developed, though often through advanced techniques like deep learning to optimize the entire communication process from transmitter to receiver without relying on traditional, modular components. Systems are being designed to directly learn and model the complex wireless channel, leading to efficient, high-performance communication.

## What is git ?
git is distributed version control.
