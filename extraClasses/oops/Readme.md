## Task

```
The Book Lovers chain of book stores have decided to go online by creating an app for their chain of book shops. The app can be used for ordering book online which will be delivered to the customers. The owners have decided to have a test app for initial feasibility testing and have approached you to develop their software. You are responsible for creating the test app before which you are to explain an overall software blue print of the different modules in the app. In particular, the owners want to test the following modules in your application:

1. Registration module. This is the module where users can register with their names (not exceeding 20 alphabets), mobile numbers (10 digits) which is compulsory, their address with location details (pin number to be checked), optional email ID (“@” symbol and “.” symbol must be present in that order in a valid mail id). The input data for registration has to be validated with appropriate messages for invalid input.

2. Book-Store details module – Here the list of book shops must be given along with the books available and cost. Users must be able to choose from the given list of shops and books in that shop.

3. Billing module – This module generates a bill for the customer which can be paid through different payment methods chosen by the user. (Cash on delivery, Paytm, Gpay, etc)

For the above project you are required to explain to the stake holders the blue print of your software application and give a sample Java test suite to test the given conditions in each module.

Use Exception handling for data validation.
 Write simple code with proper prompts for user input and simple messages as output to users.
